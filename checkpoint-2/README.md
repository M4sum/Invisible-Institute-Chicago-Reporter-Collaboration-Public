# Checkpoint 2

## Getting Started
### To run Tableau

### To run d3
In the `src` folder, open `dataVis.html` in your browser to see the visualization. To see the code, use a text editor to open `dataVis.html` for the html, `styles.css` for the css, and `chart.js` (percentile chart) and `chart2.js` (unit size chart) for the javascript.

## Our Questions
* Which police units have average complaint_percentiles above the 75th percentile?
* Which commanders oversee these high complaint units from Q1? What are their personal complaint_percentiles?
* Of those commanders, what is the percentage of high complaints units they’ve overseen (over all units they’ve overseen)? How does this compare to the average commander?
* What is the average allegation_count for these units, and percentage of those allegations have been sustained? How does this compare to the average police unit?


## Our Visualizations

### Tableau chart 1


### Tableau chart 2


### Tableau chart 3


### D3 chart
Our D3 chart is a bubble chart that shows the units as individual bubbles. The bubbles that are red have a supervisor above the 75th complaint percentile. The bubbles can be sized by their collective complaint percentile (showing how large or small of a "problem unit" they are) or they can be sized by the actual number of officers in the unit. Upon hovering over a bubble, you can see the unit's complaint percentile, their supervisor's complaint percentile, and the number of officers in the unit.
