## Trends in the Senority of Officers and Allegations

Hello and thanks for reading :)

This is our project for the invisible institute. Our theme was to explore trends in the senority of officers, and how that correlates with the amount of complaints that they have, as well as the resulting consequences from this. 
This also lead to another question - based on the findings for the question above, could we identify any bias towards certain demographic groups in these officers?
We have 5 checkpoints where we explored different aspects of our theme using data science tools and concepts. You can find the results and analysis of each checkpoint in a findings.pdf file. The README.md file in every checkpoint contains instructions with how to run our code and descriptions of the files within the repository. (taken from the royal honeybadgers readme)
Here are links to each checkpoint, as well as the final report:
